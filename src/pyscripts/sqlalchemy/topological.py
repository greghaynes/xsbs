"""Topological sorting algorithms.

The topological sort is an algorithm that receives this list of
dependencies as a *partial ordering*, that is a list of pairs which
might say, *X is dependent on Y*, *Q is dependent on Z*, but does not
necessarily tell you anything about Q being dependent on X. Therefore,
its not a straight sort where every element can be compared to
another... only some of the elements have any sorting preference, and
then only towards just some of the other elements.  For a particular
partial ordering, there can be many possible sorts that satisfy the
conditions.
