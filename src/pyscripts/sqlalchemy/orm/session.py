def sessionmaker(bind=None, class_=None, autoflush=True, autocommit=False,
                 expire_on_commit=True, **kwargs):
    """Generate a custom-configured :class:`~sqlalchemy.orm.session.Session` class.

    The returned object is a subclass of ``Session``, which, when instantiated
    with no arguments, uses the keyword arguments configured here as its
    constructor arguments.

    It is intended that the `sessionmaker()` function be called within the
    global scope of an application, and the returned class be made available
    to the rest of the application as the single class used to instantiate
    sessions.

    e.g.::

        # global scope
        Session = sessionmaker(autoflush=False)

        # later, in a local scope, create and use a session:
        sess = Session()

    Any keyword arguments sent to the constructor itself will override the
    "configured" keywords::

        Session = sessionmaker()

        # bind an individual session to a connection
        sess = Session(bind=connection)

    The class also includes a special classmethod ``configure()``, which
    allows additional configurational options to take place after the custom
    ``Session`` class has been generated.  This is useful particularly for
    defining the specific ``Engine`` (or engines) to which new instances of
    ``Session`` should be bound::

        Session = sessionmaker()
        Session.configure(bind=create_engine('sqlite:///foo.db'))

        sess = Session()

    Options:

    autocommit
      Defaults to ``False``. When ``True``, the ``Session`` does not keep a
      persistent transaction running, and will acquire connections from the
      engine on an as-needed basis, returning them immediately after their
      use. Flushes will begin and commit (or possibly rollback) their own
      transaction if no transaction is present. When using this mode, the
      `session.begin()` method may be used to begin a transaction explicitly.

      Leaving it on its default value of ``False`` means that the ``Session``
      will acquire a connection and begin a transaction the first time it is
      used, which it will maintain persistently until ``rollback()``,
      ``commit()``, or ``close()`` is called. When the transaction is released
      by any of these methods, the ``Session`` is ready for the next usage,
      which will again acquire and maintain a new connection/transaction.

    autoflush
      When ``True``, all query operations will issue a ``flush()`` call to
      this ``Session`` before proceeding. This is a convenience feature so
      that ``flush()`` need not be called repeatedly in order for database
      queries to retrieve results. It's typical that ``autoflush`` is used in
      conjunction with ``autocommit=False``.  In this scenario, explicit calls
      to ``flush()`` are rarely needed; you usually only need to call
      ``commit()`` (which flushes) to finalize changes.

    bind
      An optional ``Engine`` or ``Connection`` to which this ``Session``
      should be bound. When specified, all SQL operations performed by this
      session will execute via this connectable.

    binds
      An optional dictionary, which contains more granular "bind" information
      than the ``bind`` parameter provides. This dictionary can map individual
      ``Table`` instances as well as ``Mapper`` instances to individual
      ``Engine`` or ``Connection`` objects. Operations which proceed relative
      to a particular ``Mapper`` will consult this dictionary for the direct
      ``Mapper`` instance as well as the mapper's ``mapped_table`` attribute
      in order to locate an connectable to use. The full resolution is
      described in the ``get_bind()`` method of ``Session``. Usage looks
      like::

        sess = Session(binds={
            SomeMappedClass: create_engine('postgres://engine1'),
            somemapper: create_engine('postgres://engine2'),
            some_table: create_engine('postgres://engine3'),
            })

      Also see the ``bind_mapper()`` and ``bind_table()`` methods.

    \class_
      Specify an alternate class other than ``sqlalchemy.orm.session.Session``
      which should be used by the returned class.  This is the only argument
      that is local to the ``sessionmaker()`` function, and is not sent
      directly to the constructor for ``Session``.

    echo_uow
      Deprecated.  Use
      ``logging.getLogger('sqlalchemy.orm.unitofwork').setLevel(logging.DEBUG)``.

    _enable_transaction_accounting
      Defaults to ``True``.  A legacy-only flag which when ``False``
      disables *all* 0.5-style object accounting on transaction boundaries,
      including auto-expiry of instances on rollback and commit, maintenance of
      the "new" and "deleted" lists upon rollback, and autoflush
      of pending changes upon begin(), all of which are interdependent.

    expire_on_commit
      Defaults to ``True``. When ``True``, all instances will be fully expired after
      each ``commit()``, so that all attribute/object access subsequent to a completed
      transaction will load from the most recent database state.

    extension
      An optional :class:`~sqlalchemy.orm.session.SessionExtension` instance, or
      a list of such instances, which
      will receive pre- and post- commit and flush events, as well as a
      post-rollback event.  User- defined code may be placed within these
      hooks using a user-defined subclass of ``SessionExtension``.

    query_cls
      Class which should be used to create new Query objects, as returned
      by the ``query()`` method.  Defaults to :class:`~sqlalchemy.orm.query.Query`.

    twophase
      When ``True``, all transactions will be started using
      :mod:~sqlalchemy.engine_TwoPhaseTransaction. During a ``commit()``, after
      ``flush()`` has been issued for all attached databases, the
      ``prepare()`` method on each database's ``TwoPhaseTransaction`` will be
      called. This allows each database to roll back the entire transaction,
      before each transaction is committed.

    weak_identity_map
      When set to the default value of ``True``, a weak-referencing map is
      used; instances which are not externally referenced will be garbage
      collected immediately. For dereferenced instances which have pending
      changes present, the attribute management system will create a temporary
      strong-reference to the object which lasts until the changes are flushed
      to the database, at which point it's again dereferenced. Alternatively,
      when using the value ``False``, the identity map uses a regular Python
      dictionary to store instances. The session will maintain all instances
      present until they are removed using expunge(), clear(), or purge().

class Session(object):
    """Manages persistence operations for ORM-mapped objects.

    The Session is the front end to SQLAlchemy's **Unit of Work**
    implementation.  The concept behind Unit of Work is to track modifications
    to a field of objects, and then be able to flush those changes to the
    database in a single operation.

    SQLAlchemy's unit of work includes these functions:

    * The ability to track in-memory changes on scalar- and collection-based
      object attributes, such that database persistence operations can be
      assembled based on those changes.

    * The ability to organize individual SQL queries and population of newly
      generated primary and foreign key-holding attributes during a persist
      operation such that referential integrity is maintained at all times.

    * The ability to maintain insert ordering against the order in which new
      instances were added to the session.

    * An Identity Map, which is a dictionary keying instances to their unique
      primary key identity. This ensures that only one copy of a particular
      entity is ever present within the session, even if repeated load
      operations for the same entity occur. This allows many parts of an
      application to get a handle to a particular object without any chance of
      modifications going to two different places.

    When dealing with instances of mapped classes, an instance may be
    *attached* to a particular Session, else it is *unattached* . An instance
    also may or may not correspond to an actual row in the database. These
    conditions break up into four distinct states:

    * *Transient* - an instance that's not in a session, and is not saved to
      the database; i.e. it has no database identity. The only relationship
      such an object has to the ORM is that its class has a ``mapper()``
      associated with it.

    * *Pending* - when you ``add()`` a transient instance, it becomes
      pending. It still wasn't actually flushed to the database yet, but it
      will be when the next flush occurs.

    * *Persistent* - An instance which is present in the session and has a
      record in the database. You get persistent instances by either flushing
      so that the pending instances become persistent, or by querying the
      database for existing instances (or moving persistent instances from
      other sessions into your local session).

    * *Detached* - an instance which has a record in the database, but is not
      in any session. Theres nothing wrong with this, and you can use objects
      normally when they're detached, **except** they will not be able to
      issue any SQL in order to load collections or attributes which are not
      yet loaded, or were marked as "expired".

    The session methods which control instance state include ``add()``,
    ``delete()``, ``merge()``, and ``expunge()``.

    The Session object is generally **not** threadsafe.  A session which is
    set to ``autocommit`` and is only read from may be used by concurrent
    threads if it's acceptable that some object instances may be loaded twice.

    The typical pattern to managing Sessions in a multi-threaded environment
    is either to use mutexes to limit concurrent access to one thread at a
    time, or more commonly to establish a unique session for every thread,
    using a threadlocal variable.  SQLAlchemy provides a thread-managed
    Session adapter, provided by the :func:`~sqlalchemy.orm.scoped_session`
    function.
